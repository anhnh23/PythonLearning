The key features of encapsulation are as follow:
+ An object's behavior is kept hidden from the outside world or objects keep their state
    information private.
+ Client can't change the object's internal state by directly acting on them; rather,
    clients request the object by sending messages. Based on type of requests, objects
    may respond by changing their internal state using special member functions such as
    get and set.
+ In Python, the concept of encapsulation (data and method hiding) is not implicit, as
    it doesn't have keywords such as public, private, and protected. 
    __variable-name/function-name (with double quotes is private in Python)
